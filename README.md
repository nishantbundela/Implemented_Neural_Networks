# Implemented-Data-Science

This repo is a collection of implementation of machine learning techniques and research papers in order to help understand and simplify complex ideas and concepts.

The motivation is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms of the techniques and papers, and experiment with different approaches and ideas in a more focused and controlled environment.

The key idea was to make a useful learning tool for others who may be interested in the same topics, as it can provide a more accessible and intuitive introduction to the concepts involved
